# Session Log

## Session 001 — 2026-08-03

### Objective
Rebase the Project Brain for Enterprise AI Stage 0 and establish a safe local infrastructure-baseline collection kit.

### Completed
- Replaced test-project documentation with the Enterprise AI 10-file Project Brain model.
- Classified all un-evidenced infrastructure claims as declared/planned or `unknown`.
- Added the declared host manifest and a local, read-only collection script.
- Excluded raw collector output from Git by default.

### Verification Evidence
- `rg` found no `Arandi`, `Phase 0.5`, `GapGPT`, or `.ai/` references in Markdown/text files; all 10 authoritative documents were present.
- `bash -n scripts/collect-host-baseline.sh` passed; `--help` exited `0`; invalid `--host-id` exited `64`.
- With a mocked unavailable Docker command, the collector wrote a valid six-record JSON file and exited `2`; the temporary test output was removed.
- `git diff --check` passed; `git check-ignore --no-index evidence/example-raw.json` confirmed raw evidence is ignored; the secret-assignment scan found no matches.

### Limitations
- No connection to the five infrastructure hosts was attempted.
- No service, version, port, deployment, security, HA, backup, or monitoring claim is verified by this session.

### Next Session
Execute `ET0-002` in `NEXT_TASK.md` only after an authorized operator can run the collector locally on each host.
